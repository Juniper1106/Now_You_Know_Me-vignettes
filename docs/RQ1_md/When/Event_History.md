# When: Event History

## General Background
You are using a creative collaboration system to collaborate with an AI collaborator to design e-scooter product concepts. System functions are similar to Figma and Miro; the basic abilities of the AI collaborator are similar to ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and Yiyan.

## Scenario
After a period, you find an e-scooter concept image on the canvas that you have never seen before (the image with a yellow border in the interface below).

### Condition 1
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, after clicking on the image, you discover that the image was generated by the AI ​​collaborator. You asked the AI ​​collaborator for detailed information about the image. The interface you see is shown in the figure below.
