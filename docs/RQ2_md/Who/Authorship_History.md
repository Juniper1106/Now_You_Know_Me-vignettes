# Who: Authorship History

## General Background
You are using a creative collaboration system to collaborate with an AI collaborator to design e-scooter product concepts. System functions are similar to Figma and Miro; the basic abilities of the AI collaborator are similar to ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and Yiyan.

## Scenario
The AI collaborator and you are working on the final e-scooter concept based on the requirements and solutions already on the canvas. The AI ​​collaborator analyzed the 3 requirements you proposed and the 5 corresponding solutions proposed by you or the AI ​​collaborator, and came up with thoughts.

### Condition 1
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s thoughts are:

> "**You proposed 3 requirements, and to meet these requirements, we proposed 5 possible solutions.** My thoughts are as below:
> - For requirement 1, **you proposed solution A and solution B.** Solution A and solution B can meet this requirement, but solution A is more feasible in implementation;
> - For requirement 2, **I proposed solution C and solution D.** Solution C and solution D both proposed effective strategies for this requirement, but solution D is more cost-effective;
> - For requirement 3, **I proposed solution E, which you improved.** Solution E provides a unique and innovative idea, but may need further technical verification."

### Condition 2
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s thoughts are:

> "**Based on the existing requirements 1, 2, and 3, and 5 corresponding solutions A, B, C, D, and E.** My thoughts are as below:
> - For requirement 1, Solution A and solution B can meet this requirement, but solution A is more feasible in implementation;
> - For requirement 2, Solution C and solution D both proposed effective strategies for this requirement, but solution D is more cost-effective;
> - For requirement 3, which you improved. Solution E provides a unique and innovative idea, but may need further technical verification."
