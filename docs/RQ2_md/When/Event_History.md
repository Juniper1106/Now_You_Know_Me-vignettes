# When: Event History

## General Background
You are using a creative collaboration system to collaborate with an AI collaborator to design e-scooter product concepts. Designing experience in this system is similar to Figma and Miro; the basic abilities of the AI collaborator are similar to ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and Yiyan.

## Scenario
After designing for a period, you find a product concept image that you have never seen before (the image with the yellow border), and you ask the AI ​​collaborator for information about the image.

### Condition 1
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s response is:

> "This is a product concept image of an e-scooter, which aims to show a futuristic design concept. It emphasizes the portability and convenience of the product, while incorporating high-tech elements to make the entire design look both practical and technological.
> **The handlebar part of the e-scooter is equipped with a screen, which may be used to display information like speed and battery power, increasing the convenience and safety of use; the body adopts a streamlined design, which helps to reduce wind resistance and improve driving efficiency; the front wheel is equipped with an LED light strip, which is not only beautiful, but also improves visibility at night or in low visibility conditions; the rear wheel seems to have a hidden motor or charging port, reflecting the simplicity and integration of the design.**"

### Condition 2
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario, the AI ​​collaborator gives feedback after a period. AI collaborator’s feedback is:

> "This is a product concept image of an e-scooter, which aims to show a futuristic design concept. It emphasizes the portability and convenience of the product, while incorporating high-tech elements to make the entire design look both practical and technological.
> **Based on the time when this image was generated, it may have been in the early stages of designing this e-scooter, showing your initial idea for a portable electric scooter. You may have already identified the core functions and target market of the product.**"
