### Condition 1
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario,  the AI ​​collaborator gives feedback after a period. AI collaborator’s feedback is:

> "I noticed that during the design process, the content related to the usage scenarios and needs of family members aged 30-50 may have received less attention. I suggest considering the following content:
> 1. Increase storage space considering their daily shopping needs.
> 2. Add a child safety seat interface considering their daily pick-up and drop-off of children.
> 3. A more intuitive operation interface can be added. Ensure that the product is both practical and easy to operate for these users."

### Condition 2
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, you ask the AI collaborator for content that can be added or might be missed during the process after a period, and the AI ​​collaborator gives the following feedback:

> "I suggest considering the following content:
> 1. Add fast charging function to further enhance the user experience.
> 2. Integrate environmental sensors such as light and distance sensors to enhance the safety and intelligence of the product.
> 3. Consider introducing modular design to allow users to customize or upgrade certain parts as needed to extend the product's life and increase its flexibility."
