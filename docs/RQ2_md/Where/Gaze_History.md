### Condition 1
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s feedback is:

> "**Based on what we have, I suggest that our e-scooter should have intelligent navigation, safety warnings, and optimized battery management functions. The design pursues a streamlined body and a foldable structure to improve portability and efficiency.** If you need me to further refine these concept images or provide more suggestions, please let me know. I’m happy to help you incorporate these concerns into the final product design."

### Condition 2
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s feedback is:

> "**I noticed that you have been carefully comparing the three product concept images, and based on your past focuses, I understand that you attach great importance to the user experience of the horizontal folding mechanism, portability, the ease of maintenance, and durability of the materials. Based on these considerations and the existing content, I suggest that we can further optimize the folding mechanism, portability, and material selection in the design.** If you need me to further refine these concept images or provide more suggestions, please let me know. I’m happy to help you incorporate these concerns into the final product design."
