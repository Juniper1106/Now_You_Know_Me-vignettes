# Where: Reach

## General Background
You are using a creative collaboration system to collaborate with an AI collaborator to design e-scooter product concepts. Designing experience in this system is similar to Figma and Miro; the basic abilities of the AI collaborator are similar to ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and Yiyan.

## Scenario
After multiple iterations, the text fields A and B in the canvas (Figure 1) are hidden. AI collaborator and you are currently in the final design stage, during which the AI ​​collaborator gives suggestions. (Figure 2 shows the interface you see when checking the hidden content)

### Condition 1
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s suggestion is:

> "Here are my suggestions for the e-scooter concept:
> 1. Use a horizontal folding mechanism to reduce the footprint.
> 2. Use aluminum alloy or carbon fiber materials to ensure a lightweight carrying experience."

### Condition 2
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s suggestion is:

> "Here are my suggestions for the electric scooter concept:
> 1. **Integrate smart locks and GPS tracking systems to improve safety.**
> 2. **Tamper-resistant design, use tamper-proof screws and invisible fixing points.**
> 3. **Provide interactive online maintenance guides to facilitate user maintenance.**
> 4. Use a horizontal folding mechanism to reduce the footprint.
> 5. Use aluminum alloy or carbon fiber materials to ensure a lightweight carrying experience."
