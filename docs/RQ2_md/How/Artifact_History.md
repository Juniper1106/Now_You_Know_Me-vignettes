# How: Artifact History

## General Background
You are using a creative collaboration system to collaborate with an AI collaborator to design e-scooter product concepts. System functions are similar to Figma and Miro; the basic abilities of the AI collaborator are similar to ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and Yiyan.

## Scenario
AI collaborator and you have gone through several rounds of iterations and are now reviewing the latest design concept images. Based on a certain image, you proposed a new concept.

### Condition 1
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s subsequent behavior is:

> "I noticed that you have just made a new revision to the design concept of the e-scooter. According to historical records, you adjusted the size of the battery compartment in the last revision. I suggest reconsidering the heat dissipation design of the battery compartment based on this new size to ensure that the battery maintains optimal performance during long-term use. In addition, you can also consider adding a waterproof cover to improve the waterproof performance."

### Condition 2
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario, AI ​​collaborator’s subsequent behavior is:

> The AI ​​collaborator generates a new product concept image based on your concept.
