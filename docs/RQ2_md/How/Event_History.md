# How: Event History

## General Background
You are using a creative collaboration system to collaborate with an AI collaborator to design e-scooter product concepts. System functions are similar to Figma and Miro; the basic abilities of the AI collaborator are similar to ChatGPT, ChatGLM, and Yiyan.

## Scenario
You are sketching a graph of the e-scooter. During the process, you ask the AI ​​collaborator for suggestions on sketching, and the AI ​​collaborator gives some suggestions.

### Condition 1
You are using system **DesignPal**.<br>
In this scenario, AI collaborator’s suggestion is:

> "When sketching, I suggest you consider the following aspects:
> 1. Clarify the core functions and design goals of the product. This will help you keep the design focused and ensure that the final product can meet user needs.
> 2. Consider the design of similar products on the market and the materials and manufacturing processes that may be used.
> 3. Consider the needs and preferences of the target user group, the product's usage scenarios and operation methods, and the product's morphological language."

### Condition 2
You are using system **intCollab**.<br>
In this scenario, AI collaborator’s suggestion is:

> "I noticed that you spent a long time creating and editing design elements. To improve sketch efficiency, I suggest you consider the following aspects:
> 1. Try to use some design tools or functions, such as smart path, shape transformation, etc., to speed up the sketch process;
> 2. Roughly position the design elements first and then make detailed adjustments to avoid repeated modifications;
> 3. Try to break down the design elements into small parts, complete them one by one, and then integrate them into the overall sketch."
